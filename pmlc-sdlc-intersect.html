    <p>The intersection of the Product Management Lifecycle and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) creates a cohesive and efficient process for replacing a legacy software system with newer technology.</p>
    <p>
        In the initiation and planning phases of the Product Management Lifecycle, the need for the replacement project is identified and assessed, and a project team is formed. Simultaneously, the SDLC commences with the design phase,
        where architecture and technical specifications are outlined. The requirements gathering phase aligns the Product Management Lifecycle's detailed functional and non-functional requirements with the SDLC's design specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the development and testing phases, the SDLC focuses on building and ensuring the quality of the new software system, while the Product Management Lifecycle oversees execution and monitoring to track progress and address any
        issues. Deployment marks the joint efforts of both lifecycles, with IT coordination and user training managed by the SDLC, while the Product Management Lifecycle ensures objectives are met.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, in the closing phase, the Product Management Lifecycle evaluates the success of the replacement project, gathering feedback for future improvements. The intersection of these lifecycles ensures a seamless process, with the
        Product Management Lifecycle driving strategic decision-making and stakeholder engagement, while the SDLC manages technical development and implementation. This integrated approach guarantees a successful replacement of the legacy
        software system with the newer technology, meeting business goals, user needs, and project objectives effectively.

        Designing a process for replacing a legacy software system with newer technology involves a combination of the Product Management Lifecycle and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Below is an outline that integrates both
        lifecycles:

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Planning Phase (Product Management Lifecycle):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Define clear project objectives, scope, and success criteria for the replacement initiative.</li>
                <li>Establish a project team comprising stakeholders from various departments, including product managers, software engineers, IT, and end-users.</li>
                <li>Create a high-level roadmap outlining the stages and timelines for the replacement project.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Requirements Gathering (Product Management Lifecycle):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborate with stakeholders to gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the new technology.</li>
                <li>Prioritize features and functionalities based on business value and user needs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Commencement:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>At this point, the Software Development Lifecycle for the replacement technology will begin in parallel with the Product Management Lifecycle stages.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Design Phase (SDLC):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Based on the gathered requirements, design the architecture and technical specifications for the new software system.</li>
                <li>Define integration points with existing systems and data migration strategies.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Start the actual development of the new software system, following the design specifications.</li>
                <li>Adopt an iterative or Agile approach to development for flexibility and early feedback.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
