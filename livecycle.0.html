            <p>The terms "system lifecycle" and "application lifecycle" can have different interpretations depending on the context. Let's clarify their meanings and how they relate to the other lifecycles mentioned:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Product Lifecycle: The product lifecycle refers to the stages a product goes through from its inception to retirement. It encompasses the entire lifespan of a product, including the planning, development, launch,
                        growth, maturity, and eventual decline or discontinuation. This lifecycle considers various aspects beyond the technical realm, such as marketing, sales, and customer support.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        System Lifecycle: The system lifecycle refers to the stages and processes involved in managing a system throughout its lifespan. It encompasses the planning, development, implementation, operation, maintenance, and
                        retirement of a system. The system lifecycle focuses on the overall management of a system, including its hardware, software, infrastructure, and any associated processes or workflows.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Application Lifecycle: The application lifecycle refers to the stages and activities involved in developing and maintaining a specific software application. It includes requirements gathering, design, development,
                        testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of the application. The application lifecycle primarily focuses on the software development aspects of a particular application.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): The software development lifecycle refers to the processes and methodologies involved in developing software. It encompasses the entire development process, including planning,
                        analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The SDLC guides the development team through the stages and activities required to build a software product.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                While the application lifecycle primarily focuses on the specific software application, the system lifecycle encompasses a broader scope, including the management of the entire system (hardware, software, infrastructure,
                etc.). The product lifecycle considers the entire lifespan of a product, which can include multiple systems and applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, the system lifecycle and application lifecycle are related but not the same. The system lifecycle manages the overall system, while the application lifecycle specifically deals with the development and
                maintenance of a software application.
