        Yes, there are various templates available for documenting both functional and non-functional requirements. These templates serve as structured frameworks to capture and organize requirements effectively. While the specific format
        may vary based on organizational preferences and project needs, here are some common sections that you can include in a requirements document:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Introduction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Overview: Provide a high-level description of the project, its purpose, and goals.</li>
                <li>Document Purpose: Clearly state the purpose and scope of the requirements document.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Functional Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Cases/User Stories: Describe the specific functionalities of the system from the user's perspective.</li>
                <li>Functional Requirements: Define the specific features, actions, and behaviors the system should exhibit to meet user needs.</li>
                <li>Acceptance Criteria: Specify the conditions that must be met for each requirement to be considered successfully implemented.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Non-Functional Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance: Define performance-related requirements such as response time, throughput, or scalability.</li>
                <li>Security: Document security-related requirements such as access controls, data encryption, or authentication mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Usability: Specify requirements related to user experience, accessibility, and ease of use.</li>
                <li>Reliability: Outline requirements related to system availability, error handling, fault tolerance, or disaster recovery.</li>
                <li>Maintainability: Capture requirements that focus on the ease of system maintenance, including extensibility and modularity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Constraints and Assumptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Constraints: Identify any limitations or restrictions that may impact the development or implementation of the system.</li>
                <li>Assumptions: Document any assumptions made during the requirements gathering process.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Dependencies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>External Interfaces: Describe any dependencies on external systems, services, or APIs.</li>
                <li>Third-Party Components: Specify any third-party components or libraries that need to be integrated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Glossary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide a list of key terms and definitions used throughout the requirements document for clarity and consistency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        It's important to note that the level of detail and specific sections included may vary based on the project's complexity, industry standards, and organizational guidelines. Additionally, various software tools and requirements
        management platforms offer pre-defined templates or customizable templates that can be used to streamline the documentation process.
    </p>
    <p>Adapting a requirements template that aligns with your organization's needs and project requirements can help ensure comprehensive and well-structured documentation of both functional and non-functional requirements.</p>
