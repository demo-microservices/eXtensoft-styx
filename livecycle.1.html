                <p>Certainly! Here's an overview of the lifecycles with their stages, using <code><dl></code> (definition list) and <code><dd></code> (definition description) tags:</p>
                <dl> <dt>Project Management Lifecycle:</dt> <dd> The project management lifecycle includes the following stages: <ul> <li>Initiation: Defining project objectives, scope, and initial
                planning.</li> <li>Planning: Developing a detailed project plan, resource allocation, and risk assessment.</li> <li>Execution: Carrying out project activities and tasks according to the project
                plan.</li> <li>Monitoring and Control: Tracking progress, managing risks, and making necessary adjustments.</li> <li>Closure: Finalizing the project, documenting lessons learned, and transitioning
                deliverables.</li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):</dt> <dd> The SDLC typically consists of the following stages: <ul> <li>Requirements Gathering:
                Understanding and documenting stakeholder needs and project requirements.</li> <li>Design: Creating the software architecture, system design, and user interface layout.</li> <li>Development: Writing,
                testing, and debugging the actual code to implement the software.</li> <li>Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure quality, functionality, and performance.</li> <li>Deployment: Releasing the
                software for production use, including installation and configuration.</li> <li>Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and enhancements throughout the software's lifespan.</li>
                </ul> </dd> <dt>System Lifecycle:</dt> <dd> The system lifecycle comprises the following stages: <ul> <li>Planning: Defining system goals, requirements, and overall project
                planning.</li> <li>Development: Designing, building, and integrating system components.</li> <li>Implementation: Deploying, configuring, and testing the system in the production
                environment.</li> <li>Operation: Operating and maintaining the system, including monitoring, backups, and troubleshooting.</li> <li>Retirement: Decommissioning or replacing the system at the end of
                its useful life.</li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Application Lifecycle:</dt> <dd> The application lifecycle encompasses the following stages: <ul> <li>Requirements Analysis: Gathering,
                analyzing, and documenting software application requirements.</li> <li>Design: Creating the architectural design, interface design, and database design.</li> <li>Development: Implementing the
                application's functionality and features.</li> <li>Testing: Conducting unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.</li> <li>Deployment: Installing, configuring, and releasing the
                application for production use.</li> <li>Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and enhancements for the application.</li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Maintenance
                Lifecycle:</dt> <dd> The maintenance lifecycle typically involves the following stages: <ul> <li>Monitoring: Regularly monitoring the application/system for performance and issues.</li>
                <li>Bug Fixes: Identifying and resolving software defects or issues reported by users.</li> <li>Updates: Applying patches, security updates, and functional enhancements to the application/system.</li>
                <li>Documentation: Updating documentation to reflect changes and improvements in the system/application.</li> <li>Retirement: Planning for the eventual retirement or replacement of the
                application/system.</li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Change Management Lifecycle:</dt> <dd> The change management lifecycle involves the following stages: <ul> <li>Change Identification:
                Recognizing the need for a change and documenting the change request.</li> <li>Impact Analysis: Assessing the potential effects of the proposed change on the system/application.</li> <li>Change
                Planning: Developing a plan for implementing the change, including resources and timelines.</li> <li>Change Implementation: Executing the approved change plan and updating the system/application.</li>
                <li>Review and Evaluation: Evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the implemented change.</li> </ul> </dd> <dt>IT Service Management Lifecycle (ITSM):</dt> <dd> The ITSM
                lifecycle comprises the following stages: <ul> <li>Service Strategy: Defining the overall IT service strategy aligning with business objectives.</li> <li>Service Design: Designing IT services and
                related processes, policies, and architectures.</li> <li>Service Transition: Planning and managing the transition of services into the live environment.</li> <li>Service Operation: Ensuring IT
                services are delivered and supported to meet agreed-upon levels.</li> <li>Continual Service Improvement: Identifying areas for improvement and implementing enhancements.</li> </ul> </dd>
