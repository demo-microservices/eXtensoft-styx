    <p>Project Management Lifecycle vs. Software Development Lifecycle:</p>
    <p>Similarities:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Both are structured frameworks: Both the project management lifecycle and the software development lifecycle provide systematic approaches to managing and delivering projects.</li>
        <li>Phases and stages: Both lifecycles involve distinct phases or stages to guide the project from start to finish.</li>
        <li>Planning and execution: Both emphasize planning the work to be done and executing the defined tasks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Differences:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Scope of application: The project management lifecycle is applicable to a wide range of projects across various industries, whereas the software development lifecycle specifically focuses on developing software products.</li>
        <li>
            Deliverables: The project management lifecycle concentrates on overall project success, including budget, schedule, and stakeholder satisfaction, while the software development lifecycle aims to produce a functional software
            product.
        </li>
        <li>
            Involvement of stakeholders: The project management lifecycle involves various stakeholders throughout the project, whereas the software development lifecycle primarily centers on the development team and relevant stakeholders
            in the software domain.
        </li>
        <li>Iterative nature: Software development lifecycles often incorporate iterative and incremental approaches like Agile, while the project management lifecycle typically follows a more linear progression.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In summary, the project management lifecycle and the software development lifecycle share common structured frameworks and phases. However, they differ in their scope of application, objectives, stakeholder involvement, and approach
        to development, with the software development lifecycle focusing specifically on software product development.
