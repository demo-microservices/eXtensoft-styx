	Playbook (system reincarnation)
		Id
		Name
		Motivation/Value Proposition
			Clear concise statement of motivation, purpose, expected value
		Scope (high level statement/diagram of what's in, what's out)
		StakeHolders
		
		Risk Management
			Identify Risks (NOT SDLC risks)
				Personnel
				Organizational (no team exists?)
				Business
				Cost/Time
				Complexity
			Risk Abatement
				how identified risks are to be addressed
		Transition Strategy
			- abrupt cutover, stop-start
			- gradual weaning
			- facade cutover
			- piecemeal, component by component, part by part
			- (lookup known strategies)
			Transition Plan with estimated sequence/schedule
			
		Validation
			Scope/Size/Quality threshholds, metrics (success/failure)
			Validation Plan
				what activities need to be performed
			Validation Reporting
				compare to threshholds
		Communication
			Training
				- user, admin, system training
			Transition sequence visibility & messaging
		
		
		Playbook Stages
			Inception
				Assemble System Info (original system)
					Assemble understanding of original system
				Assemble System Info (vNext system)
					Identify Stakeholders (Product Owner, Technology Leader)
					Identify Risks (organizational,team,design/architecture,scope,size,complexity)
				
				
							Identify design/architecture/platform risks (scope,size,complexity)
							Identify organizational risks
								adjacent organizations, team size/competency
							Estimate Shirtsize
							Estimate Complexity, overall & categorize(if applicable & possible)
				Determine Stakeholders (Playbook stakeholders NOT SDLC stakeholders)
					Product Owner
					Technology Leader (architect,team lead)
					[EA Architect,Mentor]
					Playbook Facilitator

				Deliverable
					Playbook Plan
						Motivation
						Scope
			
			Elaboration
				vOriginal
					finalize 
						Assemble System Info
				vNext
					finalize System Info
						Stakeholders
						Technology Stack
						Compliance & Mandates (adherence to)
						Artifacts
							Level-0 architectural design
						Compliance & Mandate
							applicability & alignment
					Refresh & Update
						Risk List
						
					Update/refresh/confirm
						Risk List	
					Address architectural/technology/platform risk
						Architectural POC (prove out design)

					Construction Planning
						Team Composition & Roles, Team competencies
						Development & Integration environments
						Quality/Validation strategy
						Construction Phases with timetables & milestone deliverables

				Stakeholder Signoffs
				Schedule commencement of next Playbook Stage
				Execute appropriate step of Communications plan
				
			Construction (of vNext)
				
				periodic review of progress by Playbook Stakeholders
					as respects Transition Execution
						update/refresh/confirm Transition Strategy
						update/refresh/confirm Transition Validation Plan
				
				test Transition Validation Plan and prove it actually works
				Schedule commencement of next Playbook Stage
				Execute appropriate step of Communications plan
				Stakeholder Signoffs
			
			Transition Execution
				repeat until complete:
					Execute Transition Plan and Validation Plan
					Monitor Transition Metrics and Validation Metrics
					Perform Transition adjustments as needed
				Aggregate metrics
				
				Stakeholder Signoffs
				Schedule commencement of next Playbook Stage
			
			Assessment
				Perform overall assessment of the performance/quality metrics of the transition
				Assemble a Lessons Learned artifact
					what went well
					what went not so well
					any plan omissions, extraneous things
					what would i do different next time
