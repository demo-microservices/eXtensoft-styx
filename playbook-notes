		------------------------------------
		[Transition Plan]
			complex enough to be it's own topic, impacts multiple stakeholders
			requires coordination with any Data/User Migrations
			must have workable strategy (gradual,etl/cutover)
			requires Communication Plan
			
			- Training and Knowledge Transfer (users/support staff)
			- Application Testing (UAT, run side-by-side with legacy)
			- Change Management
			- Contingency Planning (backup strategies to mitigate risks of rollout)
				disruptions/downtimes, rollbacks
			- Document and Knowledge Management
			

	The more focused (not expansive) and cohesive, the better
	Each play should be centered around a single idea, or group of related ideideas
		after reading the purpose, the reader should understand WHAT (scope) of idea
			importance of idea, and benefit to THEM of the idea
		Checklist can be list of steps (sequential,or parallel) critical to success
			or of essential activities. perhaps indicate which stakeholder may perform the activity
		Key Questions are prompts, igniting thoughtful consideration, or remider
		
		
	Software Development has good number of Interests, Categories, Vectors:
		Quality
		Risk 
		Stakeholder Interests
		Governance
			Security, Compliance & Mandates, Technology guidance (platform,pattern)
	
	Orchestration/Coordination of Stakeholder Activities
	
		Stakeholders
			Business
				SME, 
				Product Owner
				Users
			Technical
				Domain Analysis
				Architecture/Design
				
			Managerial
				Project Manager

		Development Lifecyle Phases
		
			Understanding the Business Domain, Organize the Lifecycle
			Designing the System, Mitigate Risk, Planning Construction
			Executing Construction, preparing for Transition
			Transition to New System, Monitor & Adjust til Stabile

 meeting notes 8/9/2023

Dan Parry wanted clarification on scope
	already decided on deprication YES

Lester Diamon
David H
David M
Tushar Rathod
Kalpana Vadarevu

KV
	met with andreas
	Opportunities to reform into
		simpler, actionable Playbook
	tomorrow AM at 8:30am
	
list of Plays
	high level description of Playbook
	checklist of Plays
		completed/not completed/not
	must be simple/actionable
	
	after adoption/feedback we will
	change it.
	

add [Funding] (existing, org deprication)
as a point in the lifecycle?
or at least review, confirm?

i think it should be a part of the Stakeholder evaluation and Signoff

funding concerns, when mixed in with Lifecycles
really mucks it up.

Estimate,Priority,Cost evaluation at each Stage,
at least in Inception and Elaboration


Decision Made, vs Decision Pending

DAN thinks the hard part is
thinking through ways to do this that are doable
simple/actionable and DOABLE

Strategic Plan
	Tactical Plan

If you spend Distributed Sizing/Scoping activity

maybe have Replacement team do sizing/scoping

instead of Technical Lead, Technical Team?

what is the risk based decision model

DP you start out with POC to get funding approved

How to Start

What Planning is needed
	Understanding Legacy System
	Designing Replacement System
	Enumerating, Assessing, Remediating Risks
	Estimating Cost, Priority, Sizing, Complexity



Who should be involved?

Where is the Funding coming from?

Lester
How to fund it, if no benefit, then why fund it?
Lester is focused on why do it, how to pay.

	will make gereralizable list
	Dan, list based upon decision has been made
	then, HOW to get funding.

	follow up with Kavita
