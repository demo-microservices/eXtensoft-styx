        When documenting a typical service API, you would want to include various properties, elements, and details to comprehensively document its structure and functionality. Here's a list of key elements that can be used to document a
        service API:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>API Name</strong>: A clear and concise name for the API.</li>
        <li><strong>API Description</strong>: A brief description of the API's purpose and functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>API Version</strong>: The version number or identifier of the API.</li>
        <li><strong>Base URL</strong>: The base URL that serves as the entry point for the API.</li>
        <li><strong>Endpoints</strong>: A list of endpoints provided by the API, including their URLs, HTTP methods, and descriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Parameters</strong>: The parameters required for each endpoint, including their names, types, and descriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Headers</strong>: The headers expected by the API endpoints, including their names, types, and descriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Body</strong>: The data contract or payload structure expected in the request body for relevant endpoints.</li>
        <li><strong>Response Status Codes</strong>: The allowable HTTP status codes returned by the API, indicating the success or failure of the request.</li>
        <li><strong>Response Body</strong>: The data contract or payload structure returned in the response body for relevant endpoints.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Information about how errors and exceptions are handled by the API, including error codes, messages, and formats.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization</strong>: Details about the authentication and authorization mechanisms supported by the API.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: Any rate-limiting or throttling mechanisms in place to control API usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Validation</strong>: Details about the validation rules applied to incoming data and the response data.</li>
        <li><strong>Pagination</strong>: If applicable, information about pagination mechanisms for large result sets.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Considerations</strong>: Any security considerations, best practices, or recommendations specific to the API.</li>
