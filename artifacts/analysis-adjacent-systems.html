              <p><strong>Understanding Adjacent Systems in Business Domain Analysis</strong></p>
              <p>
                In the intricate web of today’s business technology landscape, the isolated view of a system offers
                limited insights. A profound understanding emerges when we unravel its connections to adjacent
                systems—those entities with which it
                interacts or upon which it relies. Here's why identifying and comprehending these systems is pivotal:

              <p><strong>Adjacent Systems in Business Domain Analysis</strong></p>
              <p>
                In a digitized ecosystem where systems rarely operate in isolation, understanding the interdependencies
                and interactions with adjacent systems becomes paramount. Adjacent systems, those which a primary system
                communicates with or
                relies upon, often hold the key to deciphering broader operational, data flow, and user journey
                complexities. Here's a comprehensive look:

                    <li>
                      Systems often need to interact seamlessly. The design must facilitate such interactions, possibly
                      through standardized protocols, APIs, or middleware solutions, ensuring data and functionality
                      exchange without friction.

                  <ul>
                    <li>If users traverse between systems, maintaining a coherent user experience is essential. This
                      might mean uniformity in design language, authentication processes, and feedback mechanisms.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>When relying on adjacent systems, contingencies for their potential downtimes or failures should
                      be baked into the design. This might involve backup mechanisms or alternative data sources.</li>

                    <li>Data exchanged between systems needs standardized formats, ensuring mutual interpretability.
                      This can affect datastore schema decisions and data transformation logic.</li>
