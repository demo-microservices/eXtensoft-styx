                    Web Application: When transitioning a web application, it's essential to plan for server provisioning, database setup, security configurations, and handling the migration of user data. Additionally, testing the application on
                    different browsers and devices should be included in the strategy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web Service: For web services, focus on defining APIs, authentication mechanisms, and data formats. Ensure compatibility with various client applications and plan for scalability and load testing to accommodate potential spikes
                    in usage.
                </li>
                <li>Database: Migrating a database requires careful planning for data migration, schema changes, and indexing. Backup and recovery procedures must be in place to avoid data loss during the transition process.</li>
                <li>Batch Job: For batch jobs, consider scheduling and automation of job execution. Error handling and logging mechanisms should be established to monitor job statuses effectively.</li>
                <li>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): In the case of ETL processes, ensure data sources and targets are correctly defined. Plan for data validation and transformation to maintain data integrity during the transition.</li>

                <li>Batch Job: Ensure that the required resources, such as servers or virtual machines, are available for executing the batch job. Set up job scheduling and monitoring mechanisms.</li>
                <li>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Check the ETL tool installation and configurations, and validate data sources and target connections.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Integration:</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Web Application: Integration testing should focus on verifying interactions with external services, APIs, or databases. Additionally, ensure that user authentication and session management work as expected during integration
                    testing.
                </li>
                <li>Web Service: Integration testing for web services involves validating the interactions with client applications and handling various error scenarios gracefully.</li>
                <li>Database: Verify the integration of the database with the application or services that use it. Test data retrieval, storage, and update operations to ensure data consistency.</li>
                <li>Batch Job: Integration testing of batch jobs involves checking job dependencies, input/output data, and error handling during job execution.</li>
                <li>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): During ETL integration testing, verify data extraction from source systems, data transformation, and loading into the target database.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Verification and Validation (V&amp;V):</li>
