    <h3>1. <strong>Size &amp; Scope of Application</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Why it Matters:</strong> The larger the scope and user base of an application, the more complex and resource-intensive the replacement might be. On the other hand, retiring small, rarely-used applications can yield quick
        cost savings and reduce IT complexity.
    </p>
    <h3>2. <strong>Business Criticality of Application</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Why it Matters:</strong> Applications pivotal to business operations need careful planning during retirement to ensure there's minimal disruption. Their replacement should ideally bring enhanced value to users and the
        business.
    </p>
    <h3>3. <strong>Basic Nature of the System</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Why it Matters:</strong> Understanding the foundational nature helps in deciding what kind of system can replace it. For instance, a legacy reporting system might be replaced with a modern BI tool, or an old CMS might be
        superseded by a cloud-based solution.
    </p>
    <h3>4. <strong>Operational Health &amp; Efficiency</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Why it Matters:</strong> An application riddled with issues or inefficiencies is a prime candidate for replacement. Conversely, applications with high operational health might just need minor upgrades instead of a complete
        overhaul.
    </p>
    <h3>5. <strong>Adjacent Dependencies</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Why it Matters:</strong> Retiring an application can impact other systems dependent on it. It's crucial to map and understand these dependencies to avoid cascading failures or disruptions.</p>
    <h3>6. <strong>Financial Perspective</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Why it Matters:</strong> Financial considerations often drive retirement decisions. If maintaining an old application is cost-prohibitive or its ROI is dwindling, it might be economically wise to replace it with a more
        cost-effective solution.
    </p>
    <h3>7. <strong>Lifecycle Perspective</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Why it Matters:</strong> An application nearing its end-of-life, with outdated technologies and no future enhancements, poses risks. It can become incompatible with newer systems, lack vendor support, and become a security
        liability.
    </p>
    <h3>8. <strong>Regulatory &amp; Compliance Perspective</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Why it Matters:</strong> As regulations evolve, applications need to stay compliant. An outdated application might fall short of current regulations, making it essential to replace to avoid legal repercussions and ensure
        data protection.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <strong>Size &amp; Scope of Application</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> To prove out a new process, starting with a moderately-sized application might be wise. It shouldn't be too small (as that won't truly test the new process) or too large (as that brings
        in a lot of risks if things don't go smoothly). <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> High. The chosen application’s size and scope will largely determine the success of the trial.
    </p>
    <h3>2. <strong>Business Criticality of Application</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> Ideally, the chosen applications for the initial test of the process should not be extremely business-critical, reducing risk in case of any unforeseen issues.
        <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> Very High. Mitigating disruption risks during the trial phase is essential.
    </p>
    <h3>3. <strong>Basic Nature of the System</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> For the initial validation of the process, it's wise to pick applications of a nature that are well-understood and for which there is expertise within the team. This ensures smooth
        handling of any issues that arise. <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> Moderate. While the basic nature helps in selection, the focus here is more on the effectiveness of the new lifecycle rather than the specific type of
        system.
    </p>
    <h3>4. <strong>Operational Health &amp; Efficiency</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> It might be strategic to select an application that already shows signs of inefficiencies or is known to have operational issues. Successfully retiring and replacing such a system will
        be a tangible demonstration of the new process's efficacy. <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> High. It presents an opportunity to showcase improvements through the new process.
    </p>
    <h3>5. <strong>Adjacent Dependencies</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> To limit variables and complications, selecting an application with fewer dependencies might be ideal for the first trial run. <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> High. Minimizing
        dependencies reduces potential complications during the initial run.
    </p>
    <h3>6. <strong>Financial Perspective</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> Initial systems should ideally not be those with high replacement costs. Demonstrating cost-efficiency, even on a smaller scale, can secure more buy-in for the new process.
        <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> Moderate. While cost is always a factor, the primary goal here is to validate the process.
    </p>
    <h3>7. <strong>Lifecycle Perspective</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> Picking an application that's nearing its end-of-life but is not extremely outdated may be a good test case. It’s still relevant enough to have impact but is also in clear need of
        retirement or replacement. <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> Moderate. The process validation remains the primary objective.
    </p>
    <h3>8. <strong>Regulatory &amp; Compliance Perspective</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Relation to the Trial Effort:</strong> Given the trial nature, it might be best to stay away from systems where compliance and regulations are too complex or stringent. Yet, addressing minor compliance issues can be an added
        feather in the cap. <strong>Importance/Criticality:</strong> Low to Moderate. While always crucial, for the sake of the trial, the emphasis might be on other factors.

    <p>The core idea is to provide a balanced testbed for the new Retire &amp; Replace process. You want to validate its efficacy without diving into the deep end with too many risks in the initial run.</p>
